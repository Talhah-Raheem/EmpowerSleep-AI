WHAT IS SLEEP HYGIENE?

Sleep hygiene refers to the collection of habits and practices that help you
get consistent, quality sleep. Good sleep hygiene creates optimal conditions
for your body and mind to rest and recover each night.

THE IMPORTANCE OF A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE

One of the most important aspects of sleep hygiene is maintaining a regular
sleep-wake schedule. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day
helps regulate your body's internal clock (circadian rhythm).

Key recommendations:
- Set a consistent bedtime and wake time, even on weekends
- Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep for adults
- Try not to vary your sleep schedule by more than one hour
- Wake up at the same time even if you had trouble sleeping

CREATING A SLEEP-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT

Your bedroom environment significantly impacts sleep quality:

Temperature: Keep your bedroom cool, ideally between 65-68°F (18-20°C).
A slightly cool room helps your body reach the optimal temperature for sleep.

Light: Make your bedroom as dark as possible. Use blackout curtains or an
eye mask if needed. Even small amounts of light can interfere with melatonin
production and disrupt sleep.

Noise: Minimize disruptive sounds. Consider white noise machines or earplugs
if you live in a noisy environment.

Comfort: Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows. Replace your mattress
every 7-10 years or when it becomes uncomfortable.

PRE-SLEEP ROUTINE

A relaxing pre-sleep routine signals to your body that it's time to wind down:

- Start winding down 30-60 minutes before bed
- Take a warm bath or shower (the cooling after helps trigger sleepiness)
- Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or gentle stretching
- Read a physical book (not a screen)
- Keep the lights dim during your wind-down routine

HABITS TO AVOID BEFORE BED

Certain activities can interfere with your ability to fall asleep:

Screens: The blue light from phones, tablets, computers, and TVs suppresses
melatonin production. Stop using screens 1-2 hours before bed.

Caffeine: Avoid caffeine for at least 6 hours before bedtime. This includes
coffee, tea, soda, and chocolate. Caffeine has a half-life of about 5-6 hours.

Alcohol: While alcohol may help you fall asleep initially, it disrupts sleep
quality later in the night and can cause more awakenings.

Large meals: Avoid heavy, rich foods within 2-3 hours of bedtime. Digestion
can interfere with sleep. A light snack is fine if you're hungry.

Exercise: While regular exercise improves sleep, vigorous exercise too close
to bedtime can be stimulating. Try to finish workouts 3-4 hours before bed.

THE BED IS FOR SLEEP

Train your brain to associate your bed with sleep:

- Only use your bed for sleep (and intimacy)
- Don't work, watch TV, or scroll through your phone in bed
- If you can't sleep after 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing
  in dim light, then return when you feel sleepy
- This helps strengthen the mental association between bed and sleep

WHEN GOOD SLEEP HYGIENE ISN'T ENOUGH

If you consistently practice good sleep hygiene but still have trouble
sleeping, it may be time to consult a healthcare provider. Persistent
sleep problems can sometimes indicate underlying conditions that need
professional evaluation.
