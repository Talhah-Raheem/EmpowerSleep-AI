COMMON MYTHS ABOUT SLEEP
========================

Sleep is surrounded by many misconceptions. Understanding the facts can
help you make better choices for your sleep health.

MYTH: "I CAN FUNCTION FINE ON 5 HOURS OF SLEEP"

Reality: While some people believe they've adapted to less sleep, research
consistently shows that adults need 7-9 hours for optimal health and
cognitive function. Studies show that people who sleep less than 6 hours
regularly often don't realize how impaired their performance has become.

Sleep debt accumulates over time. Even if you feel alert, insufficient
sleep affects memory, decision-making, reaction time, and emotional
regulation in ways you may not notice.

There is a very small percentage of people (less than 1%) with a genetic
variation that allows them to function well on less sleep, but this is
extremely rare.

MYTH: "OLDER ADULTS NEED LESS SLEEP"

Reality: Sleep needs don't dramatically decrease with age. Older adults
still need 7-8 hours of sleep. What changes is the ability to sleep:
older adults often have more fragmented sleep, wake earlier, and may
have more difficulty staying asleep.

This doesn't mean they need less sleep—it means they may need to adjust
their habits or address underlying issues affecting sleep quality.

MYTH: "IF I CAN'T SLEEP, I SHOULD STAY IN BED AND TRY HARDER"

Reality: Staying in bed while unable to sleep can actually make insomnia
worse. This trains your brain to associate bed with wakefulness and
frustration.

Instead, if you can't fall asleep after about 20 minutes, get up and do
something quiet and relaxing in dim light. Return to bed only when you
feel genuinely sleepy. This helps maintain the bed-sleep association.

MYTH: "A NIGHTCAP HELPS ME SLEEP BETTER"

Reality: While alcohol may help you fall asleep faster initially, it
significantly disrupts sleep quality. Alcohol:
- Reduces REM (dream) sleep, which is important for memory and learning
- Causes more awakenings in the second half of the night
- Can worsen snoring and sleep apnea
- Leads to earlier morning waking
- Results in less restorative sleep overall

The feeling of sleeping better with alcohol is misleading—the actual
sleep quality is worse.

MYTH: "SNORING IS HARMLESS"

Reality: While occasional light snoring is common and usually not
concerning, regular loud snoring can be a sign of obstructive sleep
apnea, a serious condition where breathing repeatedly stops during sleep.

Sleep apnea is associated with increased risk of high blood pressure,
heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. If you snore loudly
and regularly, especially with gasping or pauses in breathing, it's
worth discussing with a healthcare provider.

MYTH: "SCREENS DON'T REALLY AFFECT SLEEP THAT MUCH"

Reality: The blue light emitted by phones, tablets, computers, and TVs
does affect sleep. Research shows that blue light:
- Suppresses melatonin production more than other light wavelengths
- Shifts the circadian rhythm later, making it harder to fall asleep
- Can reduce the amount of REM sleep you get

Additionally, the stimulating content on screens (social media, news,
games) can increase alertness and make it harder to wind down.

Using night mode or blue light filters helps, but stopping screen use
1-2 hours before bed is more effective.

MYTH: "SLEEPING IN ON WEEKENDS FIXES MY SLEEP DEBT"

Reality: While you can partially recover from sleep debt by sleeping
more, weekend catch-up sleep:
- Doesn't fully restore cognitive function lost from the week
- Disrupts your circadian rhythm, making Monday mornings harder
- Creates a cycle of social jet lag

It's better to maintain a consistent sleep schedule and get adequate
sleep every night than to accumulate debt and try to repay it.

MYTH: "NAP TIME COUNTS TOWARD MY SLEEP TOTAL"

Reality: While short naps can be refreshing and have cognitive benefits,
they don't fully substitute for nighttime sleep. Nighttime sleep involves
a complete cycle through different sleep stages that's hard to replicate
during the day.

Long or late-day naps can also interfere with nighttime sleep, creating
a cycle of poor night sleep and daytime napping.

If you do nap, keep it short (20-30 minutes) and early in the afternoon.

MYTH: "I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD"

Reality: Chronic sleep deprivation isn't just uncomfortable—it has serious
health consequences. Research links insufficient sleep to:
- Weakened immune function
- Increased risk of heart disease and stroke
- Higher rates of obesity and diabetes
- Mental health problems including depression and anxiety
- Decreased cognitive function and productivity
- Higher risk of accidents

Prioritizing sleep is an investment in your health, not a luxury.

MYTH: "WATCHING TV HELPS ME FALL ASLEEP"

Reality: While TV might feel relaxing, it's not ideal for falling asleep:
- The light from the screen suppresses melatonin
- Engaging content keeps your brain active
- If you fall asleep with the TV on, sounds and light can disrupt sleep

If you need something to help you wind down, try an audiobook, podcast,
or relaxing music instead—things without the light component.

WHEN TO SEEK HELP

If you consistently have trouble sleeping despite practicing good sleep
habits, or if you experience excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring,
or other concerning symptoms, consult a healthcare provider. Sleep
disorders are common and treatable.
