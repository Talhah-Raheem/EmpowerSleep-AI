WHAT IS THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM?

Your circadian rhythm is your body's internal 24-hour clock. It regulates
not just when you feel sleepy and awake, but also influences body temperature,
hormone release, digestion, and many other biological processes.

The term "circadian" comes from Latin: "circa" (about) and "diem" (day),
literally meaning "about a day."

THE MASTER CLOCK

The circadian rhythm is controlled by a small region of the brain called
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in the hypothalamus. This "master
clock" contains about 20,000 neurons that coordinate the timing of bodily
functions.

The SCN receives direct input from the eyes, allowing it to synchronize
your internal clock with the external light-dark cycle.

LIGHT: THE PRIMARY REGULATOR

Light is the most powerful cue for setting your circadian rhythm:

Morning light: Exposure to bright light in the morning helps reset your
clock and promotes alertness. Try to get natural sunlight within 30-60
minutes of waking.

Evening light: Bright light in the evening, especially blue light from
screens, can delay your circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.

The hormone melatonin plays a key role: light suppresses melatonin production,
while darkness triggers it. This is why we feel sleepy when it gets dark.

THE SLEEP-WAKE CYCLE

Your circadian rhythm creates two peaks in sleepiness:

Afternoon dip: Most people experience increased sleepiness between 1-3 PM.
This is normal and explains why some cultures have afternoon naps (siesta).

Nighttime: The primary sleep period, when melatonin levels are highest.

There's also a period of increased alertness in the early evening, sometimes
called the "forbidden zone" for sleep because it's difficult to fall asleep
during this time.

CHRONOTYPES: MORNING LARKS VS. NIGHT OWLS

Not everyone has the same circadian rhythm pattern. Your natural tendency
for when you prefer to sleep and wake is called your chronotype:

Morning types (larks): Naturally wake up early and feel most alert in the
morning. They tend to get sleepy earlier in the evening.

Evening types (owls): Prefer staying up late and sleeping in. They feel
most alert later in the day and may struggle with early morning schedules.

Intermediate types: Fall somewhere in between, which is most common.

Chronotype is partially genetic and also changes with age. Teenagers tend
to shift toward evening types, while older adults often become more
morning-oriented.

SOCIAL JET LAG

Many people live on a schedule that doesn't match their natural circadian
rhythm, especially evening types who must wake early for work or school.
This mismatch is called "social jet lag" and can have negative effects
similar to traveling across time zones.

TIPS FOR SUPPORTING YOUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHM

1. Consistent schedule: Go to bed and wake at the same times daily.

2. Morning light exposure: Get bright light (preferably natural sunlight)
   soon after waking. This helps anchor your circadian rhythm.

3. Dim lights in evening: Reduce light exposure 2-3 hours before bed.
   Use night mode on devices and consider warm-toned lighting.

4. Regular meals: Eating at consistent times helps reinforce your
   circadian rhythm. Avoid large meals close to bedtime.

5. Avoid caffeine late in day: Caffeine can shift your circadian rhythm
   and make it harder to fall asleep at your desired time.

6. Exercise timing: Regular exercise supports healthy circadian rhythm,
   but intense exercise late at night may be disruptive for some people.

SHIFT WORK AND CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION

Working night shifts or rotating shifts can significantly disrupt circadian
rhythm. This is associated with increased health risks over time. People
who must work these schedules should consult with healthcare providers
about strategies to minimize circadian disruption.

WHEN YOUR RHYTHM NEEDS HELP

If you consistently struggle with falling asleep at appropriate times or
waking when you need to, despite good sleep hygiene, you may have a
circadian rhythm sleep disorder. Common types include:

- Delayed Sleep Phase: Falling asleep and waking much later than desired
- Advanced Sleep Phase: Falling asleep and waking much earlier than desired

These conditions are treatable with proper professional guidance, often
involving carefully timed light exposure and sometimes melatonin.
